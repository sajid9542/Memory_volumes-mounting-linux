Hello,

Greetings for the day!

Thank you for contacting AWS Premium Support. I am Suhas from S3 team and I will be glad to assist you with your case today.

As I understand from the case description that you two different domains with same Website containts and want to know how you can serve these two domains with single S3 bucket.

Using CloudFront in front of S3 bucket, you can serve two different domains with single S3 bucket as an Origin to CloudFront Distribution. You can serve up to 100 alternate domains using one CloudFront Distribution.

WorkFlow:
www.example.com/www.example.in >> CloudFront Distribution >> CloudFront Origin (S3 Bucket).

As per above work flow, both the domains will be added to CloudFront Distribution and served with the same content in S3 bucket attached as an Origin. For more information and steps to configure CloudFront, please refer a Video at [1].

I hope you found the above information helpful. Please let me know if you require any further assistance.

In case if I misunderstood the request, please explain your use case requirements in more details and I will be happy to look into it.

Have a great day ahead.
