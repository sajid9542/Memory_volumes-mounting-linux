Hi,

Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support. My name is Prankit working here with the Networking Team and I will be assisting you with your case today.
As I can see you want our help in setting up custom metrics for servers to view the metrices for memory utilization, ram utilization, root volume and other volume free space. You can do this by using unified CloudWatch agent. A high view of steps looks like:
1.      Installing the CloudWatch Agent.
2.      Attach the IAM Policy/Role so that instance receives permission to push data to CloudWatch
3.      Create the CloudWatch Agent Configuration File.
4.      Start the agent.

For the step by step procedure, you can use the following document of AWS :
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html

For your second issue that a week ago your Instanceâ€™s CPU utilization was 30% and now it is 9%, I tried troubleshooting the issue but as you have not mentioned the Instance ID and the region in which it is running, I am unable to find the resources. So, I request you to provide the specific Instance id and the Region in which you want to check this issue. I will be waiting for your response, so that I can help you in resolving this problem.

If you have any problem regarding the setting up of CloudWatch metrices also please reach to me. I will be happy to help you out.

Best regards,

Prankit M.
